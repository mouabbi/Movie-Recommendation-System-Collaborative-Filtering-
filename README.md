# üé¨ Movie Recommendation System (Collaborative Filtering)

## üìú Project Description

The **Movie Recommendation System** is a web-based application designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and ratings, using **collaborative filtering** techniques. The system will provide personalized movie recommendations by leveraging ratings provided by other users and movies the user has already interacted with.

## üöÄ Features

- **Movie Data Display (Initial Interaction)**  
  When a new user enters the site, they will see a list of the **most-rated movies** based on user feedback (popularity-based).  
  Movies are shown with details like title, description, and cover image.

- **Movie Similarity Display**  
  Once the user selects a movie to view, the app will display a list of **similar movies** based on the selected movie‚Äôs genre, director, or other collaborative features.

- **User Ratings and Data Collection**  
  After watching movies, the user can rate the movies they've watched. Each rating is stored in the system to build the user‚Äôs historical preference profile.

- **Personalized Recommendations (After User Rating)**  
  After a user has rated enough movies, the system will start recommending movies based on their **own rating history** and collaborative filtering.

- **Real-Time Recommendations**  
  As the user adds more ratings, the system will continuously update recommendations based on new data.

## üìä Collaborative Filtering Approach

The system uses **collaborative filtering**, which relies on user-item interactions (ratings). This is implemented in two ways:

1. **User-User Collaborative Filtering (Nearest Neighbor Approach):**  
   Identifies users similar to the current user based on shared preferences (ratings of the same movies).

2. **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering:**  
   Identifies movies similar to the ones the user has rated highly and recommends them.

3. **Matrix Factorization (SVD) :** 
    improves these techniques by uncovering latent features, which enhance the system‚Äôs ability to make personalized recommendations even in sparse datasets.

## üåç Workflow and Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Arrival (Cold Start Problem)
- **Step 1:** The user visits the website and sees the list of **most popular movies**.
- **Step 2:** The user selects a movie, and a list of **similar movies** is displayed.
- **Step 3:** The user watches and rates the movie.
- **Step 4:** The system stores the rating and updates the user profile.
- **Step 5:** Upon returning, personalized recommendations based on the user's ratings will be shown.

### Scenario 2: User Interaction with Recommendations
- **Step 1:** After the user rates movies, the system suggests movies based on **user-user** or **item-item** similarities.
  
### Scenario 3: Personalized Recommendations After Multiple Ratings
- **Step 1:** As the user rates more movies, personalized movie suggestions are continuously refined based on **historical ratings** and **similar users' preferences**.

## üîß Model Building (Collaborative Filtering)

### Data Processing
Your data will be structured as follows:

| userId | movieId | rating | timestamp   |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1      | 101     | 4      | 1621500000  |
| 2      | 101     | 5      | 1621500200  |
| 3      | 102     | 3      | 1621500400  |

### Model Techniques

1. **Matrix Factorization (SVD - Singular Value Decomposition):**  
   Decomposes the user-item matrix into latent factors and predicts missing ratings.

2. **KNN-based Collaborative Filtering (User-User and Item-Item):**  
   Calculates similarity between users or items and recommends movies based on similar tastes.

3. **Cosine Similarity:**  
   Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors (ratings), typically used to calculate movie or user similarity.

---

## üõ† Steps to Build the Model

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and prepare the data.
   - Normalize the ratings, if needed.

2. **Modeling:**
   - Apply **Collaborative Filtering** using SVD or KNN.
   - Use **Cosine Similarity** for calculating similarity.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like **MAE** or **RMSE** on a test dataset.

## üñ• Implementation

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **FastAPI** will provide endpoints for retrieving movie data, posting ratings, and fetching recommendations.
- Store ratings in a database (e.g., **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**) or use an in-memory database for testing.

### Frontend (React)
- **React** will display movies dynamically with ratings and recommendations.
- Allow users to rate movies and see real-time personalized recommendations.

### Model Integration
- A Python script will be used to build the recommendation model and make predictions.
- The FastAPI backend will call this model to provide recommendations to users.

## üîë Real-World Use Cases

- **Netflix:** Recommends movies or shows based on user ratings and similar user behavior.
- **Amazon:** Suggests products based on collaborative filtering of user reviews and purchase patterns.
